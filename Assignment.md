# Code Assignment

## Intro
This assignment will be used as a discussion during a technical interview.
Time constraints are part of software development and even though we don't expect a perfect solution, imagine your code to be on its way to production.
If you have to make compromises, provide a README to briefly explain pros and cons of your approach, what considerations you would make for another iteration and in general what your 
future colleagues might be interested in if they had to pick up your code.

The primary values for the code we look for are: simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability. It should be easy to scan the code, and rather quickly understand what it’s doing. 
Pay attention to naming. 
 
You may choose any coding language, and we look forward to discussing your choice.

## The Task
